## What is Roblox?

Roblox is a vast multiplayer two-in-one gaming platform that allows users to design their own games and play the games created by other users. It was first released for PC in 2006 and soon became hugely popular. In the coming years, it was made available for iOS, Android, and Xbox platforms too. It is free to play with an option of in-game purchase through a virtual currency known as Robux.

![roblox game](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roblux-game.jpg)

As of August 2020, [Robux has over 164 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox) monthly active users, a lot more than Minecraft’s 100 million users. These millions of players spend more than a billion hours playing and creating the games on Roblox. Unsurprisingly, it is a top platform for cybercriminals to release their malicious apps and codes with such a massive user base. Since most of the players are young, i.e., 13-17 yrs of age, it is relatively easy for the attackers to manipulate them to install the malware on their device.

## Does Roblox have a virus?

Roblox is a popular platform that is used by millions of people on a daily basis. So it is obviously an authentic service. However, the infiltrators can take advantage of its name and infect your system. 

If you download the game from the official sources such as Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Roblox’s official website, you need not worry about any virus. However, if you downloaded it from third-party sources, it is possible that the installer of the game has been injected with some malware files.

However, there is still a way through which the authentic Roblox game can be infected with the viruses, and that give birth to the term **Roblox Virus**. Let us know what it is.

## What is Roblox Virus?

Though the Roblox game is free to play, it has some in-app purchase options carried out through virtual currencies known as **Robux**. When you try to get Robux from the official source, i.e., from Roblox’s official website, it would cost you about $5 for at most 450 Robux, $10 for at most 1000, and so on.

Some gamers try to use unauthorized ways to gain Robux for free. Cybercriminals take advantage of such gamers and launch fake ways to earn Robux for free. One such method is a phony application known as **Robux generator,** aka Robux Virus. The Robux generator is a malicious application that claims to be a hack to provide free Robux currency to spend in the Roblox game. Unlike the official website, the gamers don’t have to pay anything for getting Robux through the Robux generator.

However, the (dishonest)players don’t know that what they have downloaded in the hope of getting free Robux is actually the gateway to the [Trojan virus](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) called Win32/OnLineGames. Once you download and install the fake Robux generator on your system, it would ask you to login with your Roblox game account to transfer the Robux. However, even after giving the account access to the app, when you open the game, you won’t find any additional Robux added. In some cases, even the already existing Robux is stolen. The Win32/OnLineGames trojan can perform more malicious tasks such as recording data like keystrokes, saved logins/passwords, browsing history, etc., providing infiltrators with remote access downloading/installing other malware, and so on.

## Symptoms of Roblox Virus

After infiltrating into your system, the Win32/OnLineGames will stealthily steal your information and conduct other malicious activities. However, by observing some irregularities, you can confirm that your device is infected with the Roblox Virus.

Here is the list of symptoms of Roblox Virus:

* After giving your account access to the Robux generator, if you didn’t get any Robux, it is an indication of a fraud app, i.e., a potential malware.
* If you notice some unusual processes running in your system’s background without your initiation, it is the hint of malicious programs installed on your PC.
* If there is a sudden surge in internet consumption, it means the trojan is collecting and sending the data from your device to its master. Never ignore the sudden spike in internet usage.
* When you get a request for changing your Roblox account’s password, it might be because of unauthorized access to it.
* When you can’t access your Roblox account anymore.
