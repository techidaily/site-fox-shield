## What is Totmania?

Totmania is a kiddish website claiming to help you find the name of the person you love. 

To reveal the name of your love, you must send out the pre-made message to 10 people. This message contains a link to Totmania website which doesn’t spreads itself. 

Totmania is harmful only when you send out messages to ten users manually. 

Owners of the Totmania site mislead gullible kids and naive internet users into believing that it can find them the love of their life. Hence, it can be categorised as a Spam or social engineering attack.

## How Totmania Virus Works?

Totmania claims to be Love Finder tool which asks its visitors to send the link to ten people. 

These ten people will further spread out the message to more people and hence spam the message network. 

It displays advertisements which is its possible revenue source. Also, the webpage zzz.totmania.net is now redirecting to Love calculator page. 

In future, it might redirect or install something false claiming apps on to user’s device. Hence, it is a possible resource for spreading Ransomware or PUPs.
