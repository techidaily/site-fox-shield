## What is WebDiscover Browser?

WebDiscover browser is a modified version of Chromium browser that pretends to be a secure, privacy-focussed browser. In reality, it displays irrelevant ads and redirects users to malicious webpages while browsing. It also promotes a fake search engine – safestsearches.com. The reason it is a fake search engine because it cannot generate its own search results; instead, it redirects the user’s search queries to Bing.com.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WebDiscover-Browser.jpg)

Most users’ do not install it willingly on their system, which is why WebDiscover browser is categorized under [Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Many users do not find anything suspicious in it and keep using it, thinking of it as the latest version of Chromium or Chrome browser.

Since Chromium is an open-source project, it is relatively easy to modify its code. Cybercriminals take advantage of this and develop malicious browsers like WebDiscover to carry out their ill-disposed work.

It is essential to know that web browsers like WebDiscover may not look threatening while browsing, but they can become the gateway for other more significant threats. As already mentioned, it can also create havoc by bombarding you with irrelevant ads and redirecting you to the dubious search engine.

## Signs that WebDiscover Browser is on your System

When the malicious WebDiscover Browser enters your system, you will notice some unusual changes happening automatically that will indicate the virus’s presence. Here is the list of some indications that confirm the infiltration of the WebDiscover Browser.

1. You will notice the WebDiscover Browser on the desktop that got installed automatically.
2. The default web browser is changed to WebDiscover.
3. There is some illegitimate search engine set as the default.
4. You see a lot of advertisements while browsing the internet.
5. The system becomes slow and sluggish.
6. The other browser you are using is hijacked, and settings are modified to promote fake search engines and web pages.

## How to remove WebDiscover Browser from the PC?

If you experience all or some of the signs mentioned in the previous section, your system is infected with an illegal WebDiscover Browser. The WebDiscover Browser usually enters your device after a [browser hijacker](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) takes control of your browser’s settings. 

To remove the WebDiscover Browser, you have to first catch and remove the culprit browser hijacker, which is the root cause, and then remove the WebDiscover, 

For that follow these steps:

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and files that try to run automatically on your system. Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in [**Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Remove Web Extensions From Browser**

You might have accidentally installed a malicious browser web extension that is responsible for the infected WebDiscover download.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, you must remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. All the extensions would be on your screen

4. Look for the ones you want to disable or remove.![manage chrome extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-chrome-extensions.jpg)
